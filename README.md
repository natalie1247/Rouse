# Rouse

This contains the code used in my rouse project: "Measuring gender bias in machine translation beyond sentence level"

The word2vec file contains preprocessing and then a word2vec algorithm from https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word2vec
which I used to create word embeddings from my dataset of human and machine translated Spanish books

The gender bias cals file creates a tsv file for use in excel processing that contains only the target vector differences
